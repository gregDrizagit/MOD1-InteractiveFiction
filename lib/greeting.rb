The year is 1980. Location: Hawkins, Indiana. You recently received a PhD in neuropharmacology from the CalTech. You were hired by the CIA to work on a top secret black budget project. Indiana bores you half to tears but the pay is extraordinary. Last week was your first on the job. This week, it all went to shit when a “patient” subject went “missing”. How the patient, a small child, managed to escape a maximum security government compound is beyond the imagination of everyone here.

This is bad. Very, very, bad. The patient is...dangerous, and the consequences of the public finding out about the work being done at the facility would be existentially catastrophic. Word came down that someone needs to track down the child and return them to safety and you are the only individual in the whole organization  who is invisible enough to the rest of the world to undertake a mission that is this potentially dangerous. One of the guards grants you the dignity of asking you your name.
