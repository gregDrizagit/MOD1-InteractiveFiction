This is a command line text-adventure interactive stranger things fan fiction. The inspiration came from other command line fiction games like Zork (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork). 

The user can move forward and backwards through a series of text descriptions we call rooms “rooms”. Along the way the user picks up “items” that interact with the text. We use databases to store and structure our text descriptions, as well as pick up, store, and retrieve items from the user’s inventory. 

The program responds to the 1 to move forward through the rooms, 2 to move backwards through the rooms, and the item name to pick up and store the items in our inventory. 

The user must have the flashlight object to move beyond room 3, and he must have a crowbar, and bat with nails to defeat the Demogorgon at the end of the game.
