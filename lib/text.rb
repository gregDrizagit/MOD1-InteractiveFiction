    The screams are definitely coming from here. Where is this anyway? You recognize this place. It looks like the old high school. You try to open the door...it opens! There’s something else here. A low grumble as if you’ve unsettled the world itself. You turn a corner and see the gymnasium ahead. You walk inside. Everything is dark. You can hardly see anything besides the light you’re carrying. You move forward and you see her. Is she sleep? As you run toward her every cell in your body suddenly freezes. You can’t see it but you know it’s here: The Demogorgon.

    You finally see it rushing toward you from your left you. You try using every weapon you have but it’s no use. Nothing can kill this thing. It’s getting closer. It’s no longer running but slowly walking, stalking, as if it knows this is game over. It stands a few feet in front of you. All you can see is it’s face...open...ready to eat. It crouches back and puts its weight on its legs. You know it’s ready to pounce. Here it comes. You close your eyes. Swing wildly with no aim. Your only thought is survival. You hear a screech! It’s gone, the floor is red. You look in your hands and you see...the bat?!? Did that actually work? You grab the girl and run out of the school, through the woods, through the portal and finally you’re back in the lab. It might be time to put in your notice...

intro = <<-text

The year is 1980. Location: Hawkins, Indiana. You recently received a PhD in neuropharmacology from the CalTech. You were hired by the CIA to work on a top secret black budget project. Indiana bores you half to tears but the pay is extraordinary. Last week was your first on the job. This week, it all went to shit when a “patient” subject went “missing”. How the patient, a small child, managed to escape a maximum security government compound is beyond the imagination of everyone here.

This is bad. Very, very, bad. The patient is...dangerous, and the consequences of the public finding out about the work being done at the facility would be existentially catastrophic. Word came down that someone needs to track down the child and return them to safety and you are the only individual in the whole organization  who is invisible enough to the rest of the world to undertake a mission that is this potentially dangerous. One of the guards grants you the dignity of asking you your name.

room1Desc1 = <<-text

You’re being escorted down the hall to the staging area by the campus' armed guards. You couldn’t back out of this now even if you wanted to. Your palms are sweating. The sterile fluorescent light and smell of heavy chemical disinfectant makes you nauseous. The pale and putrid seafoam green walls and surfaces remind you of a hospital but one with far more sinister motives. They took you to a psychological evaluation, then to a heavy chemical shower to eliminate the risk for contamination. T

he space contains equipment that you'd find in both a surgical theatre and a police interrogation room. Laid out in front of you is a yellow hazmat suit. You step into the suit. The teflon and neoprene feels protective and extremely warm around your skin. Pure oxygen is piped in through the back of the plexiglass helmet. The air is cold and burns the tip of your nostrils as you inhale, and energizes you as you take short nervous breaths. It’s still not clear where you’re going exactly. You know better than to ask...

You check your locker and you find...

The lab is still with anticipation. Dr. Modine and his colleagues are watching and waiting behind a wall of bulletproof glass nearly a foot thick. The armed guards stand at the ready at the perimeter of the room. The lab feels safe but the guards are pushing you out.

Your locker still has...

You’re escorted across the hall through two layers of bank vault doors. Your stomach churns as the massive doors slam shut and lock behind you. The thunder of the closing vault doors rattles your bones. It hits you for the first time that wherever it is you’re actually going, you’re probably never returning. A few steps beyond the last vault door lies something so bizarre that it violates your arrogant scientific understanding of reality. It looks like something that could only exist in a painting of Salvador Dali or Hieronymus Bosch. It’s a seething passageway that is 25 feet tall. Root-like tendrils are pouring out of the passage and extending into the lab. Whatever is coming out of this world, is slowly swallowing our world whole.

God only knows where the passage leads…”probably straight to hell”, you think. You’re horrified to see a body wrapped in a bloody yellow hazmat suit splayed out in front of the portal. There is a firearm in his hands. Maybe he tried to hurt whatever it is that got him. He must have been in the construction crew working last week. Some construction equipment still litters the area. You turn away from the body in horror. The sealed vault doors behind you assure that there’s definitely no turning back now.

You found a...

The guards left the vault doors ajar. You try not to look at the body. There is a tool box, a bundle of rebar, a few wooden 2x4s, and the firearm left by the other poor fellow. Unfortunately, you know that your only potential way out, is through hell.

You found a...

Everything looks the same...but different. An eerie fog clouds your vision. There is no sun here. There is no moon. There is only destruction and a constant feeling of pending danger. What was that!?.  Screams! The kid! She’s alive...I hope. It sounds like it’s coming from the woods. Your hair stands up on your skin. Your heart starts to race.

room3Desc2 = <<-text

Darkness...nothing but darkness. What is this place? You have to find some light. You turn back.

room4Desc1 = <<-text

The ground is soft. Mushy. Is it mud? You turn on your flashlight and look down. The ground is a deep crimson. The smell: rancid but familiar. You feel like you know what this is but cannot confront what’s real. Could it be? The entire forest? You take another step. Your foot soaks deep into the ground as if it’s molding to the ridges in your boots. Your back foot hits a tree root and you stumble. Your flashlight falls out of your hands, hits a tree and turns off. You try to get up. Your hands press deep into the surface.

You feel the ground absorb your weight then grow firm. You try to get up and your hands slip on some water on the ground. You fight to keep your balance while you blindly search the ground for your flashlight. Finally you’ve found it. You knock it against your palm once and the light flickers. One more time...that does it. The handle is red. The light is red. That was not water...Just ahead you see what looks like a crowbar. Why would something like that be here? The screams again! What would you like to do?

This forest again. This stench is unbearable.

The screams are definitely coming from here. Where is this anyway? You recognize this place. It looks like the old high school. You try to open the door...it opens! There’s something else here. A low grumble as if you’ve unsettled the world itself. You turn a corner and see the gymnasium ahead. You walk inside. Everything is dark. You can hardly see anything besides the light you’re carrying. You move forward and you see her. Is she sleep? As you run toward her every cell in your body suddenly freezes.

You can’t see it but you know it’s here: The Demogorgon. You finally see it rushing toward you from your left you. You try using every weapon you have but it’s no use. There’s nothing you can do here. There must be something you can use that’s more effective. You run for your life and barely make it outside of the school. It stops chasing you...it must be protecting it’s prey. You can’t leave her in there with that thing.
